Recommendation System for Amazon Electronic Products: Development and Evaluation with Item-to-Item Approach

Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that utilizes the item-to-item collaborative filtering (CF) method to provide personalized product recommendations based on electronic product data gathered from Amazon. The system aims to suggest the most relevant and engaging products to users based on their past purchases and ratings.

Dataset:

This project will utilize electronic product data collected from Amazon. The dataset will encompass various attributes such as product IDs, names, descriptions, categories, prices, user reviews, and ratings. The size and complexity of the dataset will determine the project's scope and level of challenge.

Planned Phases:

The project consists of the following phases:
Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing operations will be performed, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and resolving inconsistencies.
Data Analysis: Data exploration techniques will be employed to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Various techniques will be applied to create new features or transform existing ones.
Model Training: The item-to-item CF algorithm will be selected and modeled to provide product recommendations to users.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance will be assessed using different evaluation metrics.
Results and Discussion: The findings and results will be summarized, and the model's performance and limitations will be discussed.
Enhancement and Future Work: Potential avenues for model improvement and future research directions will be identified.

These phases will ensure a comprehensive and systematic completion of the project. Detailed information and code snippets for each phase will be provided in the README file.
